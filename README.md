* [Appendix](https://github.com/SAILResearch/supportmaterial-18-jiayuan-SO_bounty/blob/master/appendix.pdf)
* Data: 
  * [Data](https://github.com/SAILResearch/supportmaterial-18-jiayuan-SO_bounty/blob/master/data_model/data_solvingLikelihood) for the sovling-likelihood of bounty questions (i.e., Section  5).
  * [Data](https://github.com/SAILResearch/supportmaterial-18-jiayuan-SO_bounty/blob/master/data_model/data_solvingLikelihood_nonBounty) for the sovling-likelihood of sampled non-bounty questions (i.e., Section 5).
  * [Data](https://github.com/SAILResearch/supportmaterial-18-jiayuan-SO_bounty/blob/master/data_model/data_solvingTime) for the solving-speed of bounty questions (i.e., Section 6).
* Model:
  * [Script](https://github.com/SAILResearch/supportmaterial-18-jiayuan-SO_bounty/blob/master/data_model/SolvingLikelihoodModel.R) for the model of solving-likelihood for bounty questions (i.e., Section 5)
  * [Script](https://github.com/SAILResearch/supportmaterial-18-jiayuan-SO_bounty/blob/master/data_model/SolvingLikelihoodNonBountyModel.R) for models of solving-likelihood for the non-bounty questions and the bounty questions without bounty factors (i.e., Section 5).
  * [Script](https://github.com/SAILResearch/supportmaterial-18-jiayuan-SO_bounty/blob/master/data_model/SolvingSpeedModel.R) for the model of solving-speed model for bounty questions (i.e., Section 6)
